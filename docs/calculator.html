    <h1>GeoFlightPlanner Calculator Help</h1>

    <div class="note">
        <p>This calculator is part of the GeoFlightPlanner QGIS plugin and assists in drone flight planning by providing essential calculations based on your sensor parameters.</p>
        <p><b>Usage Rules and Behavior:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sensor Selection:</b> For the calculators to function correctly, it is <b>mandatory</b> to select a sensor under "1.1 Drone Model" in the "1. Global Flight Settings" section. If no sensor is selected or if the sensor data is incomplete, the calculators will not provide results and will display a warning message.</li>
            <li><b>Sensor Fields (Read-Only):</b> Fields displaying sensor parameters (Width, Height, Focal Length, etc.) are automatically populated based on the selected sensor and are for informational purposes only. They cannot be edited directly.</li>
            <li><b>Dynamic Calculations:</b> Results are updated automatically as you enter values into the input fields.</li>
            <li><b>Flight Type and Camera Orientation:</b> Selections in "1.2 Flight Type" and "1.3 Camera Orientation" directly influence Overlap and Spacing calculations, adjusting formulas and result labels to reflect the context (horizontal/nadir flight or vertical/facade flight, and camera orientation).</li>
            <li><b>Add Custom Sensor:</b> You can add your own custom drone/sensor models in the "Add Custom Sensor" section for use in the calculators.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Global Flight Settings</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>1.1 Drone Model:</h3>
        <div class="field-description">
            <strong>Function:</strong> Selects the drone/sensor model whose parameters will be used in all calculator computations. It is the basis for all calculations.
            <br><strong>Behavior:</strong> If "Select a Sensor..." is chosen, the calculators will not function, and the "Following terrain - Sensor" Processing tool will require a valid selection.
        </div>

        <h3>Add Custom Sensor:</h3>
        <div class="field-description">
            <strong>Function:</strong> Allows you to add a new drone/sensor model to the local database. Useful for unlisted drones or custom configurations.
            <br><strong>Fields:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Drone/Sensor Name:</b> Unique name for the new sensor.</li>
                <li><b>Pixel Size (µm):</b> Sensor pixel size in micrometers.</li>
                <li><b>Focal Length (mm):</b> Lens focal length in millimeters.</li>

                <li><b>Max. Camera Angle (º):</b> Maximum camera tilt angle (for vertical flights).</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Calculation:</strong> The "Calculate and Add" button calculates the sensor width and height in mm based on pixel size and image resolution, and adds the new sensor to the <code>drone_data.json</code> file.
        </div>

        <h3>1.2 Flight Type:</h3>
        <div class="field-description">
            <strong>Function:</strong> Defines the flight type to adjust overlap and spacing calculations.
            <br><strong>Options:</strong> "Horizontal Flight (Nadir)" (for area mapping) or "Vertical/Facade Flight" (for vertical structure mapping).
        </div>

        <h3>1.3 Camera Orientation:</h3>
        <div class="field-description">
            <strong>Function:</strong> Defines the camera orientation (landscape or portrait) relative to the flight line, which affects the interpretation of sensor dimensions in calculations.
            <br><strong>Options:</strong> "Landscape" or "Portrait".
